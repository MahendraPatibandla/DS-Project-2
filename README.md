# DS-Project-2
Duplicate Question Pairs
Implemented a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on identifying
duplicate question pairs within a dataset. Utilized machine learning techniques and text similarity algorithms to
identify and classify pairs of questions that convey similar semantic meaning. Employed Python programming and
NLP libraries to preprocess text data, extract features, and train a model capable of detecting duplicate question
pairs accurately. Demonstrated proficiency in NLP methodologies, feature engineering, and model development for
semantic similarity analysis.
